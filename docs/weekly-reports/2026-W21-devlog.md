# 2026-W21 — Dev log (Week of May 18 to May 24)

## 2026-05-18 — Control Reports admin group

Added `/admin/control-reports/` as the parent for weekly machine-generated reports a human reviews and merges. Index lists governance + spec-drift; each links to a trend page that mirrors the existing GovernanceTrend layout.

**Why**: enterprise procurement (Darden DD form) and SOC 2 CC4 expect a single coherent evidence story for continuous human oversight of AI-built code. The two control reports were previously surfaced unevenly — governance had `/admin/governance` + a parseable weekly file, spec-drift only appended to the running devlog with no persistent artifact and no chart.

**What changed**:
- `scripts/spec-drift.ts` gains `--write-weekly` which writes `docs/weekly-reports/YYYY-WXX-drift.md` (parseable: summary metrics table + drift detail).
- `lib/specDriftReports.ts` parses those files; mirrors `lib/governanceReports.ts`.
- New routes: `/admin/control-reports/` (index), `/admin/control-reports/governance/` (existing trend, moved), `/admin/control-reports/spec-drift/` (new trend).
- `/admin/governance` is now a 308 redirect to the sub-route so external bookmarks keep working.
- Top-nav admin entry renamed "Governance Reports" → "Control Reports" pointing at the new index.
- `.claude/commands/spec-drift.md` now instructs the Monday 02:00 ET routine to use `--write-weekly` and commit the standalone file rather than appending to the devlog.
- `docs/weekly-reports/2026-W21-drift.md` produced as the first real drift report (0 drifted, 12 specs updated this range).

**Next**: when the routine runs next Monday it will produce `2026-W22-drift.md`, the trend chart gets its second data point, and week-over-week delta starts showing.
